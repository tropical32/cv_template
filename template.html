                    <p class="mb-1">At Enchanted Brands Ltd., I crafted marketing strategies that significantly transformed the company’s online presence, leading to a 200% increase in followers and even a noticeable rise in my boss's respect. I led a team of creative wizards to develop campaigns that consistently hit KPIs, all while sprinkling in just the right amount of puns to keep things magical. Additionally, I mastered the art of turning data into actionable insights—or at least making it seem that way.</p>

I also took the lead on influencer partnerships, carefully selecting internet personalities who were famous for reasons we never quite understood. Moreover, I organized events that were almost as memorable as the swag bags, ensuring both brand visibility and plenty of smiles from attendees.</p>
